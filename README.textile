h1. Textpattern mode for Panic's Coda

This is a "Textpattern":http://textpattern.com/ mode for "Panic Coda":http://www.panic.com/coda/ on a Mac - enables Textpattern CMS specific tag syntax in Coda when editing files of suffix @x.txp@.


h2. Installation

# Download and unzip Textpattern.mode.
# Drag the folder into @~/Library/Application Support/Coda/Modes@.
# If Coda is currently running, quit and relaunch.

*Note for Mac OSX Lion users:* by default Apple have hidden the library directory in Lion home folders - you can show it again by opening the terminal and entering the following command:

bc. chflags nohidden ~/Library

h2. Known issues

# The Textpattern state is not currently reading the autoconplete - possible an error somewhere in the regex code.
# The autocomplete is, erm, incomplete! Got to write a proper @CodaCompletion.plist@ instead of the current @AutocompleteAdditions.txt@.
